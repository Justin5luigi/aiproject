# Steam recommendation ai project
Script starts out by requesting a steam id, then requests a number of games to look through (more games equals better results but takes longer), then asks for the number of results to show. Then, it will get all the games that person owns, and gets all the tags in those games and gives each tag a weight. At the end each tag's weight should be how many hours total a game with that tag was played, plus a bonus if a game with that tag was played within the last two weeks. After this, it will start pulling games off of steam, and then for each tag that game has, check if the tag is a tag the user has played with, and if it is, get the weight of that tag and add it to the score for that game. After it does this for every tag in the game it is given a final score, and then it moves onto the next game to review. After it goes through all the games, it sorts all the games reviewd based on their score, and then presents the top scores gathered. That is the core of the algotihm, there are some extra things I added to make using it a little easier such as being able to save the tag weights as a json file so you dont have to re-get them every time its run, and then being able to save the results to a txt file.
